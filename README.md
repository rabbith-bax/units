# units-system.js

The purpose of this task is to create a unit system with ability to convert and format values.
It should be done by implementing methods of the Units class in the units.js file.
The expected behavior of each method is defined by unit tests in the units.test.js file.
Tests are divided into two groups:
- Required - tests which should pass to complete the task
- Bonus - tests, the passing of which gives you extra points
As a result of your work we expect only units.js file with implemented methods.

Requirements:

- nodejs with npm (version 16 or newer) (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Installation:

- `npm install`

Running:

- `npm run test`
